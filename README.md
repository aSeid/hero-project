# Mutants and Masterminds 3E Demo
===============
This is a brief simulation of running a M&amp;MM 3E game, to demonstrate the variant rules for Hit Points instead of Toughness Saves. 

This simulation is coded in HTML5 and Javascript, and the page itself is developed and streamlined through GitHub.

First, choose a hero.
