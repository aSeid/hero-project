# Mutants and Masterminds 3E Demo
===============
This is a brief simulation of running a M&amp;MM 3E game, to demonstrate the variant rules for Hit Points instead of Toughness Saves. 

This project is meant to combine the efforts of coding for other programs and utilizing that code to build an interactive and completely streamlined experience for comparison of methods.
