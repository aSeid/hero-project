<p>This page is meant to provide a brief example of a Mutants and Masterminds game, using rules in the third edition of the game, to demonstrate variant rules for Hit Points rather than Toughness saves.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-we-built-this" class="anchor" href="#why-we-built-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why We Built This</h3>

<p>Using GitHub to create a launching point for the site, and combined efforts from two people who enjoy both working on programs such as this one as well as streamlining the actual gameplay of RPGs, the authors of this particular page welcome you to enjoy the fruits of their labors and run a simple simulation, using revised rules of damage calculations rather than the skill checks and complex calculations used in the published ruleset.</p>

<h2>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>
<p>The first in the list of variables we address is the class of character chosen. Each class has different strengths and weaknesses, described as different bonuses to each skill value.</p>
<p>In the standard rules written for the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds, damage taken by the character is directly related to the Toughness skill of the character in question, and is augmented and calculated through various other bonus values given by the other, more complicating variables. For now, we're starting with just the classes in question. </p>
